        What is ReplaceMyFood? Imported food produces an estimated 4 times greater environmental impact than
        domestically produced food (Source: <a href="http://www.ceeonline.org/">Center For Environmental Education</a>).
        Local food also taste better as it is able to naturally ripen and supports your local economy. ReplaceMyFood
        gives you the place to advertise your locally sourced products as well as search for ways to replace your
        imported food.
